## Known Issues

1. **Terminal Output Suppressed** - PowerShell terminal commands execute but don't show output in IDE
2. **Additional Pages Needed** - 31 mockups exist but only 9 React components generated manually

---

## Next Steps

1. Run `node scripts/compile-learnplay.js` to regenerate all pages from mockups
2. Start dev server with `npm run dev`
3. Test user flows for each role (Student → Teacher → Parent → Admin)
4. Deploy Edge Functions if not already done
