These special creatures can live both in water and on land. Frogs come in many different sizes and colors. Some are as small as a penny, while others can be as big as a dinner plate. You might see green frogs near ponds, brown frogs in gardens, or even bright red and blue frogs in rainforests!\\n\\n[IMAGE:A colorful tree frog sitting on a leaf]\\n\\nFrogs have some really cool features that make them special. They have smooth, wet skin that helps them breathe. Their big, bulging eyes help them see in almost every direction. Most frogs have long, strong back legs that are perfect for jumping and swimming. Did you know that some frogs can jump more than 20 times their own body length? That would be like you jumping across a basketball court in one leap!\\n\\n[SECTION:Where Frogs Live]\\n\\nFrogs need to live near water because their skin must stay moist. You can find frogs in ponds, lakes, streams, and even in wet forests. Some frogs live in trees, while others burrow underground. Frogs are cold-blooded, which means their body temperature changes with their surroundings. When it gets cold, many frogs hibernate by burying themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds or under leaves on the forest floor.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"study-concepts\",\n      \"title\": \"Frogs Key Concepts\",\n      \"order\": 2,\n      \"content\": \"[SECTION:The Life Cycle of a Frog]\\n\\nFrogs have one of the most amazing life cycles in nature! It all starts when a mother frog lays eggs in water. These eggs are covered in jelly and often stick together in big clumps. After about a week or two, tiny tadpoles hatch from the eggs. Tadpoles look nothing like adult frogs—they have long tails and no legs, and they swim like little fish! Tadpoles breathe through gills, just like fish do.\\n\\n[IMAGE:Diagram showing frog life cycle from eggs to tadpole to froglet to adult frog]\\n\\nAs tadpoles grow, something magical happens called metamorphosis. First, they grow back legs, then front legs start to appear. Their tail gets shorter and shorter as their body absorbs it. They develop lungs so they can breathe air. After about 12 to 16 weeks, the tadpole has transformed into a tiny frog! This process is one of nature's most incredible changes.\\n\\n[SECTION:What Frogs Eat and How They Help Us]\\n\\nFrogs are carnivores, which means they eat other animals. Adult frogs love to eat insects like flies, mosquitoes, beetles, and moths. They catch their prey with their long, sticky tongues that shoot out super fast—in less than a second! Some larger frogs even eat small fish, worms, or other frogs. Tadpoles are different—they mostly eat algae and tiny plants in the water.\\n\\n[IMAGE:A frog catching a fly with its tongue]\\n\\nFrogs are very important to our environment! They eat thousands of insects, including mosquitoes that can spread diseases. This makes frogs natural pest controllers. Frogs are also an important food source for other animals like birds, snakes, and fish. Scientists study frogs to learn about the health of our environment because frogs are very sensitive to pollution and changes in their habitat.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 0,\n      \"text\": \"A frog laid 45 eggs in a pond.
