Some muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdle attach to the spine. The spinal column consists of 33 (or sometimes 34) vertebrae. They provide stability and make sure that the trunk and neck are sufficiently mobile. In addition, the spinal column protects the spinal cord and nerves that pass through the spinal column. Intervertebral discs, which connect the various vertebrae, are located between the vertebrae. All of these contribute to the flexibility of the spine.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The spine is divided into five parts, from top to bottom. Individual vertebra are denoted with a letter based on its location in the spine, and a number from top to bottom:</p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Cervical vertebrae</strong>: C1 &ndash; C7</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Thoracic vertebrae</strong>: T1 &ndash; T12</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Lumbar vertebrae</strong>: L1 &ndash; L5</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Sacrum</strong>: S1 &ndash; S5</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Coccyx</strong> <strong>(tailbone)</strong>: this consists of three to five fused vertebrae that are not displayed separately with a letter and number.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n\t[$CELL]\n\n\t\t[$IMG(\"/media/Animations/De wervelkolom_vertaald_EN.png\";358,300;1.96)]\n\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX]","Name":"Introduction to the spine"}]}
