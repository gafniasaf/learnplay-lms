Such \"key coloration\" was an essential part of much eighteenth- and nineteenth-century music and was described in treatises of the period.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, in tunings with a wolf fifth, the key on the lowest note of the fifth sounds dramatically different from other keys (and is often avoided). In Pythagorean tuning on C (C, E+, G: 4, 5, 6), the major triad on C is just while the major triad on E♯+++ (F♮) is noticeably out of tune (E♯+++, A+, C: ​4 1⁄8, 5, 6) due to E♯+++ (521.44 cents) being a Pythagorean comma (23.46 cents) larger sharp compared to F♮.\n</p>\n<p>\nMusic using equal temperament lacks key coloration because all keys have the same pattern of intonation, differing only in pitch.\n</p>\n\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX]\n","Name":"Key coloration"}]}
