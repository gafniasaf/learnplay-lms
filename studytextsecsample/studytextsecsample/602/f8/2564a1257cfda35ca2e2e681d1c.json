After sequestering cyanide that is bound to cytochrome oxidase (a mitochondrial enzyme that plays an important role in cellular respiration), methemoglobin transforms into cyanomethemoglobin, and then into thiocyanate (catalyzed by the enzyme rhodanese), which is a less toxic metabolite that is excreted in urine.</p>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX]","Name":"Mechanism of action"}]}
