Therefore, advising the members of the health care team assigned to the client to cut fingernails short may significantly reduce the incidence of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>infection. Wearing sterile gloves when providing care to the client is not necessary as long as the nurse has short or medium length nails and has performed aggressive hand washing. Initiating airborne precautions is not recommended because transmission of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> occurs from client to client on the hands of health care workers, or by contact or ingestion of contaminated materials. Placing the client in isolation room is not necessary because the health care team can also be a source of infection.</p>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n\t[$CELL]\n\n\t\t[$IMG(\"/media/Images/shutterstock_644576902.jpg\";200,300;3)]\n\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX] ","Name":"SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CARE ENVIRONMENT 131"}]}
