Symptoms of hypoglycemia, bradycardia, and hypotension are rare in children after ingesting this dose. Therefore, observation is sufficient. Treatment with activated charcoal is not recommended due to the risk of aspiration and should be started only if the child ingests more than 2 tablets of beta-blockers. Observation for 12-24 hours is indicated in case of hypoglycemia. Continuous cardiac monitoring is also recommended, especially in intoxication with sotalol.</p>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX]","Name":"Therapy in Children Younger than 6 Years"}]}
