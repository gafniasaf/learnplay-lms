Clearance can be defined as the volume of blood that is fully cleared of the drug per unit of time (L/hour or L/hour/kg).</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Liver Clearance</strong></p>\n\t\t\t<p>Metabolism by the liver is one of the main routes for the elimination of a wide variety of drugs.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Hepatic clearance can be defined as the amount of blood in the liver that is cleared of the drug per unit of time. There are three parameters that determine how much of a drug is cleared by the liver:</p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Blood flow through the liver (<strong>Qh</strong>): reflects how much drug is delivered to the liver;</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Fraction of unbound or 'free' drug (to plasma proteins) in the blood (<strong>fu</strong>): refers to the percentage of the drug that is capable of interacting with liver enzymes;</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Intrinsic capacity of the liver enzymes to metabolize a particular drug (<strong>Cl<sub>int</sub></strong> intrinsic clearance): represents the ability of the liver to clear drugs, independent of blood flow limitations or protein binding of the drug.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p>The relationship between the hepatic clearance and the hepatic blood flow is called the hepatic extraction ratio (ER). This ratio is between 0 (the arterial drug concentration is equal to the venous drug concentration) and 1 (the venous blood is completely cleared of the drug during liver passage). With the following formula, the ER can be calculated:</p>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>ER = ([C]art &ndash; [C]ven)/[C]art<br />[C]art = arterial plasma drug concentration<br />[C]ven = venous plasma drug concentration\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Extraction ratios are classified as high (&gt; 0.7), intermediate (0.3-0.7), or low (&lt;0.3), depending on the fraction of a drug removed after a single pass through the liver. Drugs with an ER of &gt;0.7 are also called 'high-clearance drugs' and drugs with ER &lt;0.3 are called 'low-clearance drugs'.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<p>The total hepatic Clearance of a drug (in mL/min) can be calculated with the following formula:</p>\n\t\t\t<ol start=\"2\">\n\t\t\t\t<li>Hepatic Clearance Cl(h) = Qh x ER<br /> Qh = bloodflow through the liver<br /> ER = extraction ratio</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<p>When the parameters intrinsic capacity and protein binding are included in this formula, the Rowland's equation (3) is used:</p>\n\t\t\t<ol start=\"3\">\n\t\t\t\t<li>Hepatic Clearance Cl(h) = Qh [(fu x Cl<sub>int</sub>)/(Qh + fu x Cl<sub>int</sub>)]<br />Qh = bloodflow through the liver<br />fu = fraction of unbound drug<br />Cl<sub>int </sub>= intrinsic clearance capacity of hepatocytes for a specific drug</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<p>where ER = [(fu x Cl<sub>int</sub>)/(Qh + fu x Cl<sub>int</sub>)]</p>\n\t\t\t<p>and the total intrinsic liver clearance (Cl<sub>total int</sub>) = (fu x Cl<sub>int</sub>)</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This can also be written as:</p>\n\t\t\t<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n\t\t\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td valign=\"center\">4.
