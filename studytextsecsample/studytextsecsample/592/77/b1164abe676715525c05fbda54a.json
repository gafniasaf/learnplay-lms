Cardiac cells are refractory from the moment depolarization starts, until the end of the repolarization. The start of depolarization is seen as the initiation of the QRS complex on the ECG. The end of the repolarization corresponds with the end of the T-wave. So, the refractory period is synchronous with the QT-interval.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The refractory period includes an initial phase in which a new impulse can never lead to a new depolarizationThis phase is called the absolute refractory period. It lasts about 0.25-0.30 seconds in the ventricles and 0.15 seconds in the atria.<br> The final phase of the refractory period is the relative refractory period, which lasts up to 0.05 seconds. During this interval, sufficiently strong stimuli can lead to a new action potential. This relative refractory period is associated with the R on T phenomenon and increased the risk of [$LINK(\"torsade de pointes\"; 162232)].</p>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n\t[$CELL] \n\n\t\t[$IMG(\"/media/Animations/actiepotientiaal_moleculen_celwand6.swf\";273,300;2)]\n \n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX]","Name":"Absolute and relative refractory periods"}]}
