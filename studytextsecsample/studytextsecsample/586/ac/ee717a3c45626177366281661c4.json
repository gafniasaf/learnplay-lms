This in turn allows blood to surge through the tear, separating the inner and middle layers of the aorta. The most common symptom of aortic dissection is sudden, severe, tearing pain on the chest or upper back. Dissection can be classified according to the sites involved:</p>\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n    [$CELL]\n\n            [$IMG(\"/media/Images/shutterstock_1565385058.jpg\";264,300;2.65)]\n\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$BOX]\n\t[$CELL]\n\t\t[$BLOCK]\n\n\t\t\t<ol>\n              <li> DeBakey type I – originates in the ascending aorta and the aortic arch. </li>\n              <li>DeBakey type II – is limited to the ascending aorta.</li>\n              <li> DeBakey type III – begins in the descending aorta and extends to the diaphragm.</li>\n            </ol> \n\t\t\t<p>The priority nursing intervention is to reduce aortic wall tension and limit the extent of dissection via administration of IV beta blocker medication such as labetalol, metoprolol, or propranolol. These drugs prevent aortic rupture by lowering the heart rate and blood pressure. Preparing for surgery is not a priority at this time because surgical interventions are recommended for clients with DeBakey type I and II aortic dissection. Administration of morphine may help relieve pain; however, this intervention will not prevent aortic rupture. Assessing the client's level of consciousness is not a priority because it will only delay treatment.</p>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX] \n[$/BOX] ","Name":"SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CARE ENVIRONMENT 435"}]}
