These muscles are connected to the AV-valves via tendons called <strong>chordae tendineae</strong>. The papillary muscles have no active function in opening or closing the AV-valves. When the AV-valves close the papillary muscles contract, thus providing a controlled mechanism of preventing the AV-valves from protruding into the atria during ventricular systole. This mechanism prevents the backflow of blood from the ventricles into the aorta during ventricular systole. Rupture of a papillary muscle or of the chordae tendineae may result in leakage of an AV-valve, allowing the backflow of blood into the atria during ventricular contraction. This leakage, in turn, may result in heart failure. </p>\n\n        [$/BLOCK]\n\n    [$/CELL]\n    [$CELL]\n\n        [$IMG(\"/media/Animations/papillair_en.swf\";224,300;2)]\n\n    [$/CELL]\n[$/BOX] ","Name":"Papillary muscles and Chordae tendineae"}]}
