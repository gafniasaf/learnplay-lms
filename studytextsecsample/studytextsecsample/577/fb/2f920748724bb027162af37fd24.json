However, gray areas between categories exist. Sometimes, factors that affect the risk classification of a research are multiple and unknown. Hence, risk assessment should not be considered an end in itself but a means to guide monitoring, including the proper allocation of human and material resources. In instances when there are differences in the opinion of researchers in the risk classification, or if there are doubts in the classification itself, the frequency and intensity of monitoring can be customized.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The following section presents a checklist of the most important factors to consider in the risk classification of research.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong><em>Frequency / magnitude</em></strong></p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>What is the magnitude of the risk?</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p><strong><em>Risks of an intervention or drug</em></strong></p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Amount of knowledge and experience with the intervention, drug, food, or medical device on humans</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Known risks</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Probability of occurrence of unknown risks, such as those in early-stage drug research</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Severity of possible adverse events</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Predictability of adverse events</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Possibility of controlling / treating unwanted effects of interventions</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Reversibility of possible adverse events</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Physical burden (pain, discomfort)</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Psychological burden (anxiety, stress)</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p><strong><em>Characteristics of the study population</em></strong></p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Vulnerability (seriously ill, frail elderly, young children)</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p><strong><em>Social risks</em></strong></p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>For the subject: privacy, stigmatization, exclusion from insurance</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>For the study: social support, sensitivity of the investigation</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p><strong><em>Risks associated with research design and implementation</em></strong></p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Complexity of the protocol (risk of protocol violations)</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Number of subjects to be included</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\t\n\t[$CELL]\n\n\t\t[$IMG(\"/media/Images/shutterstock_165163964.jpg\";257,300)]\n\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX]\n","Name":"Checklist of factors to consider in risk classification"}]}
