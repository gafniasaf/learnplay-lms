To minimize the metabolic rate and gastrointestinal stimulation, the nurse should encourage the client to remain on complete bed rest. Decreased metabolism and gastrointestinal stimulation reduce discomfort by minimizing pancreatic activity. Placing the client in a semi-Fowler&rsquo;s position reduces pressure on the diaphragm, thereby decreasing pain intensity. Foods with strong odor can lead to sensory stimulation, which in turn activates pancreatic enzymes and increases pain. Administration of intravenous fluids helps correct electrolyte abnormalities and hypovolemia. Morphine is contraindicated for clients with acute pancreatitis because it can induce spasm in the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in increased pain.</p>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX] ","Name":"PHYSIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY 84"}]}
