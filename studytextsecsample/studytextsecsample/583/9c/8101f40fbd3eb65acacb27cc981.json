However, this method only focuses on the patient&rsquo;s behaviour. Behavioural therapy seeks to identify and help change potentially self-destructive or unhealthy behaviour. It functions on the idea that all behaviour is learned and can be changed. The focus of treatment is often on current problems. Memories from the patient&rsquo;s youth are only discussed minimally.</p>\n\n\t\t[$/BLOCK]\n\t[$/CELL]\n\t[$CELL]\n\n\t\t[$IMG(\"/media/Images/shutterstock_297767849.jpg\";250,300)]\n\n\t[$/CELL]\n[$/BOX]","Name":"Behavioural therapy"}]}
