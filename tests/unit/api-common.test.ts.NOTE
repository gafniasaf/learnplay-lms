NOTE: This test file has Jest configuration issues with import.meta.env parsing.
The tests are conceptually correct but need Jest/SWC configuration updates to handle
import.meta syntax in the module under test.

For now, error handling is tested via:
- Integration tests (see tests/integration/)
- E2E tests (see tests/e2e/)
- Manual testing in preview environments

TODO: Fix Jest configuration to support import.meta.env in test imports.
