They are used before main verbs to modify their meaning.\n\nCommon modal verbs include: can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.\n\n[SECTION:Key Rules]\nModal verbs follow special grammar rules:\n1. They do not change form (no -s, -ed, or -ing)\n2. They are always followed by the base form of the main verb\n3. Questions are formed by inverting the modal and subject\n4. Negatives are formed by adding 'not' after the modal\n\nExample: She can swim. (NOT: She cans swim)",

(informal)\n- Could I use your phone? (polite)\n- May I leave early? (formal)\n\n[SECTION:Common Mistakes]\n❌ Can you to help me?\n✅ Can you help me?\n\nRemember: Modal + base verb (no 'to')",
