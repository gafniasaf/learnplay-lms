These giant creatures live in the ocean, but they are not fish—they are mammals, just like you and me. This means whales breathe air, give birth to live babies, and feed their young with milk. Some whales are so big that they are the largest animals that have ever lived on our planet!\\n\\n[IMAGE:A blue whale swimming in the ocean with a small boat nearby for size comparison]\\n\\nThere are many different types of whales living in oceans all around the world. Some whales, like the blue whale, can grow longer than three school buses put end to end! Other whales, like the orca (also called a killer whale), are smaller but very smart and live in family groups called pods. Whales can dive deep into the ocean, sometimes staying underwater for over an hour before coming up to breathe through blowholes on top of their heads.\\n\\n[SECTION:Why Whales Are Special]\\n\\nWhales are important to our oceans and our planet. They help keep the ocean healthy by moving nutrients around as they swim and dive. Many whales travel thousands of miles each year, migrating from cold feeding areas to warm waters where they have their babies. Learning about whales helps us understand how to protect these magnificent creatures and the oceans they call home.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"study-concepts\",\n      \"title\": \"Whales Key Concepts\",\n      \"order\": 2,\n      \"content\": \"[SECTION:Types of Whales]\\n\\nScientists divide whales into two main groups: toothed whales and baleen whales. Toothed whales, like dolphins, orcas, and sperm whales, have teeth and hunt for fish and squid. Baleen whales, like blue whales, humpback whales, and gray whales, don't have teeth at all! Instead, they have special plates called baleen that hang from their upper jaw like a curtain. These plates work like a strainer, filtering tiny animals called krill and small fish from the water.\\n\\n[IMAGE:Side-by-side comparison showing a toothed whale's mouth and a baleen whale's baleen plates]\\n\\n[SECTION:How Whales Live]\\n\\nWhales have special adaptations that help them survive in the ocean. Their bodies are streamlined and smooth, which helps them swim fast through the water. They have a thick layer of fat called blubber that keeps them warm in cold ocean waters. Whales use their powerful tails, called flukes, to push themselves through the water. Unlike fish that move their tails side to side, whales move their flukes up and down!\\n\\n[SECTION:Whale Communication and Behavior]\\n\\nWhales are very social and intelligent animals. Many whales communicate with each other using sounds—some make clicks, others make whistles, and humpback whales are famous for their beautiful songs that can last for hours! These songs can travel for many miles underwater. Whales also breach, which means they jump out of the water and splash back down. Scientists think whales might breach to communicate, play, or remove parasites from their skin.\\n\\n[IMAGE:A humpback whale breaching, jumping out of the water with water splashing around it]\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 0,\n      \"text\": \"A blue whale can grow up to 100 feet long.
