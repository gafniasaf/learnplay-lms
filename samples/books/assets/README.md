# Sample Book Assets Bundle

This folder is used to build `samples/books/assets.sample.zip` for live E2E and local testing.

**Zip root contract (IMPORTANT):**
- The zip root must contain folders like `images/` and `figures/` directly.
- Do **not** add an extra top-level `assets/` folder inside the zip.

Expected paths:
- `images/chapter_openers/chapter_1_opener.svg`
- `figures/sample/figure_1.svg`
