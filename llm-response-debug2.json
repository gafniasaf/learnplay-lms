These fascinating creatures have long, flexible bodies covered in smooth scales. Unlike other animals, snakes don't have legs, arms, or eyelids. They move by sliding their bodies in special wave-like patterns across the ground. Some snakes can even climb trees or swim in water!\\n\\n[IMAGE:A colorful garden snake slithering through grass]\\n\\nThere are about 3,000 different types of snakes on Earth. They come in many sizes, from tiny thread snakes that are only as long as a pencil to giant pythons that can grow longer than a school bus! Snakes live in deserts, forests, grasslands, and even in the ocean. Most snakes are shy and prefer to hide from people. They are important animals that help keep nature in balance by eating mice, rats, and other small creatures.\\n\\n[SECTION:Snake Bodies and Senses]\\n\\nSnakes have special bodies that help them survive. Their scales protect them like armor, and they shed their skin several times a year as they grow. Snakes are cold-blooded, which means they need to warm up in the sun or cool down in the shade to control their body temperature. Even though snakes don't have ears on the outside of their heads, they can feel vibrations in the ground to sense when something is moving nearby. They also use their forked tongues to \\\"smell\\\" the air and find food!\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"study-concepts\",\n      \"title\": \"Snakes Key Concepts\",\n      \"order\": 2,\n      \"content\": \"[SECTION:How Snakes Eat and Hunt]\\n\\nSnakes are carnivores, which means they only eat meat. Different snakes hunt in different ways. Some snakes, like pythons and boas, are constrictors. They wrap their strong bodies around their prey and squeeze until the animal can't breathe. Other snakes, like cobras and rattlesnakes, use venom (a special poison) to catch their food. Snakes can't chew their food, so they swallow it whole! Their jaws can open very wide, and their stretchy skin allows them to eat animals that are bigger than their own heads.\\n\\n[IMAGE:Diagram showing a snake's flexible jaw structure]\\n\\n[SECTION:Snake Habitats and Behavior]\\n\\nSnakes live in almost every habitat on Earth except Antarctica. Desert snakes, like sidewinders, have special ways of moving across hot sand. Tree snakes are often green or brown to blend in with branches and leaves. Water snakes have flat tails that help them swim. Most snakes are solitary, which means they like to live alone. They only come together to mate and have babies. Some snakes lay eggs, while others give birth to live baby snakes. Baby snakes are called hatchlings, and they can take care of themselves as soon as they're born!\\n\\n[SECTION:Staying Safe Around Snakes]\\n\\nMost snakes are harmless to humans and are actually helpful because they eat pests like mice and rats. Only about 600 types of snakes are venomous, and they usually only bite when they feel scared or threatened. If you see a snake in nature, the best thing to do is stay calm and give it plenty of space. Never try to touch or catch a wild snake. By learning about snakes and respecting them from a distance, we can appreciate these incredible reptiles and the important role they play in our environment.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 0,\n      \"text\": \"A garden snake is 24 inches long.
